  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We are <strong>My Brother’s Keeper</strong> — not a club, but a family.  
      A tight circle of brothers and sisters who share a bond built on trust, loyalty, and love.  
      Some of us ride, some of us don’t, but every one of us stands shoulder to shoulder when it comes to helping those who need it most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is simple: <strong>to give back</strong>.  
      Whether it’s feeding the homeless, helping veterans, supporting fallen riders’ families,  
      or lending a hand to anyone who’s struggling — we believe in doing what’s right, not what’s easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This group was born from loss — from the heart of a fallen brother whose dream was to build something that mattered.  
      In his honor, we stand united. His spirit drives us forward, reminding us that life’s purpose isn’t found in what we own,  
      but in who we stand beside and what we give back.
    </p>

    <p>
      We carry his name, his passion, and his light with us every day.  
      <strong>Till Valhalla, Brother. Your legacy lives through us.</strong>
    </p>
