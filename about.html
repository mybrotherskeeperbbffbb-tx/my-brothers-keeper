  <h1>Our Mission</h1>

  <p>
    We are <strong>My Brother’s Keeper</strong> — a family bound by love, loyalty, and a shared heart for compassion.  
    This is not a club. It’s a brotherhood and sisterhood of real people who care deeply for one another and for our communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each of us has known one another long enough to call each other family.  
    We’ve shared laughter, tears, and memories that can’t be replaced.  
    When one of us falls, we all feel it.  
    That bond is what drives us to do good — not because we have to, but because it’s what he would’ve wanted.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project, this page, this movement — it’s all dedicated to our fallen brother.  
    His dream was to see people helping people: feeding the hungry, clothing the homeless,  
    lifting up veterans, and reaching out to anyone who’s lost their way.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re not perfect, but we stand united in love, loyalty, and action.  
    If there’s someone out there in need, we’ll find a way to lend a hand.  
    For him. For each other. For anyone who could use a reminder that compassion still exists.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Until Valhalla, Brother — this one’s for you.</strong></p>
