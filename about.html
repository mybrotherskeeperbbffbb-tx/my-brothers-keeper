  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>
    We are more than a group — we are a family.  
    My Brother’s Keeper was built on love, loyalty, and the unbreakable bond of brotherhood.  
    Together we stand for compassion, courage, and community.  

    Each of us has walked different paths, but we share one heart — a heart that beats for one another,  
    for the homeless, for the hungry, for our veterans, and for every soul who’s fallen on hard times.  
    We don’t look away. We reach out, we lift up, and we do what we can, when we can, however we can.  

    This movement was born in the memory of one of our own — a brother who carried love and light  
    in a world that can be dark. This is for him. This is for all of us.  
    His dream was to see good men and women come together to make a difference,  
    and that’s exactly what we’ll keep doing — in his name, with his strength, until Valhalla.
