    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      My Brotherâ€™s Keeper isnâ€™t just a name â€” itâ€™s a promise.  
      We are a family of brothers and sisters bound not by blood, but by loyalty, compassion, and the memories of those weâ€™ve lost.  
      This mission began with one of our own â€” a brother whose heart was as big as his dreams.  
      His vision was simple: to bring people together, to help those who canâ€™t help themselves, and to be a light in a world that sometimes grows dark.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ride, we work, we give, and we love â€” not for recognition, but because itâ€™s what he would have done.  
      Every meal shared with the homeless, every coat given to someone cold, every moment spent lifting another soul â€” itâ€™s all in his honor.  
      We stand together as family, lifting one another, and reaching into our communities with open hands and open hearts.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a club. Itâ€™s not a gang. Itâ€™s a brotherhood â€” a family â€” that believes in doing whatâ€™s right, no matter how hard the road.  
      We dedicate this page, this project, and this dream to our fallen brother.  
      His spirit rides with us in every act of kindness and every mile we travel.  
      Until Valhalla, Brother. ðŸ’š
    </p>
