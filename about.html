  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We are more than a group — we are a family. My Brother’s Keeper was born out of loyalty, love, and the unbreakable bond of brotherhood. Together we stand with compassion for others and commitment to our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of us has walked different paths, but we share one heart — a heart that beats for one another, for the homeless, for the hungry, for veterans, and for every soul who’s fallen on hard times. We look away from no one, because we can’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      This movement was born in the memory of our brother, a man who carried love and light into a world that can be dark. This is for him. This is for all of us. His dream was to see good men and women come together to make a difference, and that’s exactly what we’ll keep doing — in his name, with his strength.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Until Valhalla.</strong></p>
