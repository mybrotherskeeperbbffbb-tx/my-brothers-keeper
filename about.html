  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>
    We are more than a group — we are a family.  
    My Brother’s Keeper was born out of love, loyalty, and a promise: to look out for one another and to carry on the dream of our fallen brother.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of us ride, some of us don’t — but all of us care.  
    We’re bound by a shared heart for doing good, for helping the homeless, for supporting veterans, for lifting those who have fallen, and for serving our communities in any way we can.  
  </p>
  <p>
    We’re not a club or an organization built on titles.  
    We’re a family bound by respect, trust, and the belief that love and loyalty mean something in a world that often forgets.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Every act of kindness, every meal handed out, every blanket shared, every dollar raised —  
    it’s all for him, and for every soul who’s ever needed a hand when the road got rough.  
  </p>
  <p>
    This page, this movement, this mission — is dedicated to our brother.  
    Gone from our sight, but never from our hearts.  
    Until Valhalla.
  </p>
