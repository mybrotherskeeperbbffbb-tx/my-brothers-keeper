  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We are more than a group — we are a family. My Brother’s Keeper was built from love, loyalty, and an unbreakable bond of brotherhood. 
      Together we stand in compassion and community, walking our own paths but sharing one heart that beats for one another, for the homeless, 
      the hungry, for veterans, and for every soul who’s fallen on hard times.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t just look away — we reach out. We lift those who need it, because we understand. This isn’t just a name — it’s a promise.
      This movement was born in the memory of one of our own, a brother who carried love and light into a world that can be dark.
      His dream was to see good men and women come together to make a difference — and that’s exactly what we’ll keep doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is for him. This is for us.  
      <strong>Until Valhalla.</strong>
    </p>
